 Quandles are algebraic structures that arise in the fields of knot theory, statistical mechanics, and mathematical chemistry; other than being interesting algebraic objects. Quandles can therefore benefit from the help of computational tools, much like groups. This thesis introduces \Software, a modern tool dedicated to the study of quandles built on the solid mathematical foundations of the most recent developments in Quandle Theory, and Universal Algebra. \Software~is built as a module for the computer algebra system \magma~and it aims to improve \rig, the only package explicitly dedicated to quandles. By building on tools such as \magma~and \rig~that have withstood the test of time, and taking inspiration from modern tools such a \cream, \Software~offers algorithms to compute the key structures of any algebraic object such as the automorphism group, the set of subalgebras, the set of congruences and it also allows to find monomorphisms and isomorphisms between quandles, if they exist. This thesis also introduces a novel algorithm to compute the set of congruences of a quandle. The powerful underlying system, \magma, as well as a careful implementation of the algorithms allow \Software~to outperform both \rig~and \cream, in most cases.
